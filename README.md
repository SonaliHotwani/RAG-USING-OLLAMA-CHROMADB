# RAG-USING-OLLAMA-CHROMADB

This is an example of a Simple RAG application using python, chromaDb and Ollama model.

I have showcased an example using llama 3.2:3b and codellama. You can choose different models as per your need. 
This project showcases how simple AI agents can be build. This can be useful for those who are starting their journey in AI.

For this RAG to work, 
1. Add a data directory and place your data files in those. 
2. Give an appropriate name for your DB and collection.
3. While running this on local, make sure a new DB directory is created which has embeddings of the data that you want to query on.
